More than 150 former officers of the
overthrown South Vietnamese government have been released from a
re-education camp after 13 years of detention, the official
Vietnam News Agency reported Saturday.
The report from Hanoi, monitored in Bangkok, did not give
specific figures, but said those freed Friday included an
ex-Cabinet minister, a deputy minister, 10 generals, 115
field-grade officers and 25 chaplains.
It quoted Col. Luu Van Ham, director of the Nam Ha camp south
of Hanoi, as saying all 700 former South Vietnamese officials who
had been held at the camp now have been released.
They were among 1,014 South Vietnamese who were to be released
from re-education camps under an amnesty announced by the
Communist government to mark Tet, the lunar new year that begins
Feb. 17.
The Vietnam News Agency report said many foreign journalists
and a delegation from the Australia-Vietnam Friendship
Association attended the Nam Ha release ceremony.
